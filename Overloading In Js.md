#### Overloading Concept in JavaScript

As we know that in hashtable the name of the variable is key which is string,And key cannot be duplicate.

Thats why overloading is not possible in javascript. But we can use the overloaded function.

But we also know that javaScript objects are extensible

so we can

    - add New Key
    - remove key
    - update the key Value

Also if we want we can make it not extensible using two methods.

    - Object.seal();
    - Object.freeze();
